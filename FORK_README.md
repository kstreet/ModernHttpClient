**What Is This Fork In Here For?**

This fork is in the kstreet GitHub account because the fork is the copy that is referenced and currently used with:

- A private `.MvxPlugins` project needs references to the `Cheesebaron.MvxPlugins.ModernHttpClient.*` projects and that repo relies on the [BINARY releases](https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient/releases) from [https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient](https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient).  Because the source for those binaries is available (this repo), we keep a copy of it.

**How Fresh Is This?**

- The code in this fork was current/similar to the ` paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient`
 repo up through [this December 21, 2013 commit](https://github.com/paulcbetts/ModernHttpClient/commit/0541e682e6e6be0909a1837f114b80e85752f683).
